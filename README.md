üõ†Ô∏è Improvements & Suggestions
Area	Issue	Suggestion
Layout	Tables used for layout	Use semantic HTML (div, section) and CSS Grid/Flexbox
Accessibility	No alt text descriptions	Add meaningful alt attributes
Responsiveness	Static widths	Add responsive meta tags and use % or media queries
Typos	Many spelling errors	Proofread and fix: "CUMMTER" ‚Üí "COMMUTER", "DEALR" ‚Üí "DEALER", etc.
Code Structure	No CSS used	External CSS for styling and responsive design recommended

üìå Conclusion
This HTML wireframe serves as a static prototype of a cycle e-commerce site. While basic and functional, enhancements in semantic HTML, responsive design, and spelling accuracy will significantly improve quality and usability.
